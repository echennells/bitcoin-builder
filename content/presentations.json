          "body": "The Lightning Network is a Layer 2 payment protocol that operates on top of Bitcoin. It enables instant, low-cost transactions by creating payment channels between users.\n\nKey benefits:\n- Instant transactions\n- Low fees\n- Scalability\n- Privacy improvements"

          "title": "How Payment Channels Work",
          "body": "Payment channels allow two parties to transact multiple times off-chain, with only the opening and closing transactions recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThis dramatically reduces on-chain transaction volume while maintaining Bitcoin's security guarantees."
        },
        {
          "title": "Routing and Network Effects",
          "body": "The Lightning Network uses a routing protocol that allows payments to be sent through multiple channels, even if the sender and receiver don't have a direct channel.\n\nAs more nodes join the network, routing becomes more efficient and reliable."
