This presentation walks through how the team turns loose ideas into structured content blocks, ships them through a Next.js + Vercel pipeline, and keeps iterating with ChatGPT Projects and Cursor Agents—often from a phone. Attendees will see how education-first workflows create real value for the Bitcoin ecosystem while laying the groundwork for future decentralized features.",

          "body": "The Builder Ops Team frames vibe coding as an education multiplier. Every guide, FAQ, or slide deck removes friction for the next contributor, so the first priority is building a resource center that anyone can remix. By keeping the spotlight on education, Builder turns documentation into a product that compounds value for the ecosystem."

          "body": "Instead of copy-pasting prose, Builder breaks information into small JSON structures. Those blocks power the website today and can be piped into mobile apps, newsletters, or agent prompts tomorrow. ChatGPT sessions always end by distilling insights straight into schema-friendly snippets so future surfaces can re-use the same source of truth."

Cursor Pro keeps build momentum high with AI pair programming, rapid refactors, and the new Agents feature for parallel work—even from a phone. Code flows into GitHub, deploys to Vercel previews, and returns with feedback in minutes."

The same vibe coding habits will power each milestone."
