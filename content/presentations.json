Users maintain full control of their identity through cryptographic keys, ensuring portability and sovereignty. The protocol is simple and extensible, allowing for rapid innovation. Most importantly, Nostr is censorship-resistant—since content flows through multiple independent relays, no single point of failure or control exists. This makes it ideal for communities that value free speech and decentralization."

        {
          "title": "Privacy and Censorship Resistance",
          "body": "Nostr's design prioritizes privacy and censorship resistance. Users can choose which relays to use, implement encryption for private messages, and maintain pseudonymous identities. This makes Nostr particularly valuable for communities that face censorship or value privacy. The protocol's decentralized nature means that even if some relays are blocked or shut down, the network continues to function through other relays."

As the protocol continues to evolve and gain adoption, it offers builders new opportunities to create social and economic interactions that aren't possible on traditional platforms. The presentation concludes with thoughts on how Nostr and Bitcoin together can reshape how communities connect and collaborate."

This required exploring new technical approaches beyond traditional mobile apps."

Then came the crazy idea: merge Bitchat with Cashu. Why? So kids could use their balance at the coffeeshop offline. Cashu tokens are bearer instruments. As long as the POS is online, they clear."
